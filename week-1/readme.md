A wiki site for information about the Invader Zim fandom. Invader Zim is a cartoon show.

**Explanation of Concept Usage**

This site has a popup to navigate through the photo gallery. I believe that this is using JavaScript to control when the popup is showing or hidden. I believe this because the popup shows when you click the initial image then hides when you click the x button.

### Code Worksheet

<!-- markdown focused worksheet -->

Task 1

Format all "Task #" titles as a heading 3.

Task 2

Format a strikethrough for the EcmaScript (ES) version that wasn't released and write below the list what the EcmaScript versions are for.

- ES1
- ES2
- ES3
- ES4
- ES5
- ES6

**What is EcmaScript used for?**

Task 3

Below create a table serving as an analogy between the 3 browser languages and something of your choosing. The 3 browser languages being Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS). Have a header row containing 2 columns: Browser Language and your analogy title.

If I was using the analogy of a human body then HTML would be the skeleton, CSS the skin, and JS the brain. I might title this analogy Human Body. _**(You cannot use this example)**_

**Analogy Table:**

Task 4

Copy and paste the following prompt into an AI tool of your choice then copy and paste the generated JavaScript into the code block below.

```js
// waiting for code
```

Imagine that you are a brain needing to tell the human body how to perform the steps needed to test out this feature on the app. Write an ordered list with the instructions for testing the code above. _**(Do not use AI for this step)**_
